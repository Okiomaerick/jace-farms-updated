                Turkana is one of Kenya's most vulnerable regions ‚Äî harsh climate, limited access to education, and persistent food insecurity paint a tough picture. The Skill Grow Project brought hope through practical interventions that could be scaled, replicated, and owned by the community.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                At Jace Farms, we believe in solutions that are sustainable, inclusive, and impactful. The success of this project reaffirms our commitment to empowering communities, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, with tools that drive long-term change.
